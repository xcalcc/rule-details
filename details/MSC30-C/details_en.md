#### Abstract
The program is using a pseudorandom number generator that can produce a predictable sequence of numbers.

#### Explanation
The rand() function produces numbers that are not truly random and may have a short cycle. An attacker can guess the next value that will be generated. Programmers should use a better random function that is properly seeded.
