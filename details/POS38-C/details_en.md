#### Abstract
Beware of race conditions when using fork and file descriptors

#### Explanation
When forking a child process, file descriptors are copied to the child process, which can result in concurrent operations on the file. Concurrent operations on the same file can cause data to be read or written in a nondeterministic order, creating race conditions and unpredictable behavior.
