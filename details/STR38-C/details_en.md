#### Abstract
The program is using functions and parameter with mismatching character size or type for the size of characters in the string.

#### Explanation
The program is passing a pointer to an object and a size parameter to the library function. The two parameters, when combined, will cause the library function to access this object but outside its valid range, resulting in an undefined behavior.
