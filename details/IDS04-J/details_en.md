#### Abstract
The program is extracting file entries from a zip file using java.util.zip.ZipInputStream without sanitization or resource guard measures.

#### Explanation
When using the java.util.zip package to extract file entries from a zip file then file names may contain path information. These file names must be canonicalized and validated to prevent path injection attacks. Resource usage must also be tracked to ensure resources will not be exhausted that could result in a denial of service.
