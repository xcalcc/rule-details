#### Abstract
The program has used std::rand(), which is not a good candidate for random number sequences.

#### Explanation
Pseudorandom number generator like rand() uses mathematical algorithms which makes numbers not completely random. Numbers generated by std::rand() doesn't give a good enough quality for random number sequences due to its comparatively short cycle. Hence, using rand() is not advised.
