#### Abstract
The program is calling the standard library function but failed to check and handle the function error returns.

#### Explanation
The program is calling a standard library function(s). These functions typically return a valid value, or some form of value that indicates an error. Failure to check if the call is successful leads to an unexpected or undefined behavior. Please refer to the language or system specification for a full description of the standard interface. Please note that there are system functions for which return values do not need to be checked. The list of these functions can also be found in the system or language specification. Notably the most popular ones are printf, vprintf, memcpy, memmove, strcpy, strcat, memset (and their wide char versions).
