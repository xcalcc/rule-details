#### Abstract
Sensitive data leakage arises When unsanitized user input are logged or put out in standard output (stdout) device.

#### Explanation
Logging unsanitized user input can result in sensitive data leakage across a trusted boundary. A log injection attack may arise leading to further information leakage. This vulnerability is not limited to Java programs. C/C++ programs can subject to the same attack as show in the C example.
