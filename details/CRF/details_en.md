#### Abstract
The program has a call sequence that results in recursion at runtime

#### Explanation
Recursion happens when a function (e.g. A) calls another function in such a way that the call sequence eventually calls A again. In its most simple form, a function simply calls itself during the execution. If not programmed correctly, this could lead to an infinite loop. It can also cause an excessive use of stack space and may lead to running out of memory or stack space problems.
