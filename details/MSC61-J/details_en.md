#### Abstract
The program is using weak cryptographic algorithms for security sensitive code.

#### Explanation
Security and privacy sensitive information should be using strong encryption algorithms. Strong algorithms may include AES with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and AES with Cipher Block Chaining mode.
