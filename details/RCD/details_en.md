#### Abstract
Redundant statements that are control dependent.

#### Explanation
When there are two conditional statements that are dependent in execution flow, then one conditional can logically subsume the other conditional statement. In that case, the other conditional is redundant and unnecessary. This could be due to an editing error and is a code quality issue.
