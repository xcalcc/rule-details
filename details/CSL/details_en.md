#### Abstract
The program has a call sequence that causes the runtime stack to exceed the call depth limit set by the user.

#### Explanation
Function A calls another function B. Function B may in turn call another function C. This call chain can go on infinitely. In embedded systems, when the call stack is too deep, it may cause unintended side effects like running out of memory, inefficient execution time, etc.
