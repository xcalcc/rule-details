#### Abstract
An external declaration that defines an external entity (typically specified by an URI) should be properly filtered. 

#### Explanation
The external entities should be filtered, either through a whitelist or pre-registration so that XML attacks can be contained. Failure to do so could result in denial of service or data leakage.
